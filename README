How to build and run the project? 

1. Put the zip file 'djin-project2.zip' to a directory on cse and unzip it: 

    $ unzip djin-project2.zip

2. Go to resulting directory 'context_free': 

    $ cd context_free

3. Build the project: 

    $ ant

4. Run the project with an input (let's run q1.txt as an example): 

    $ java -jar ./build/jar/context_free.jar < ./input/q1.txt

The output would look something like: 

yes
